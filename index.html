					<p class="BS3">"Even if Donald Trump hadn’t been running for President, 2016 would have been an important year for him in his role as the head of the Trump Organization. His hotel operation, in particular, is on course for a rapid worldwide expansion, from fourteen hotels to more than a hundred, according to a June interview with Eric Danziger, the C.E.O. of Trump Hotels. The firm added three new hotels, in Washington, D.C., Canada, and Panama, during the year and is looking at opportunities in the Dominican Republic, London, Frankfurt, Munich, Amsterdam, and Tel Aviv. In Asia, a hotel and residential complex in Bali, Indonesia, is under way, as are projects in Mumbai and Pune, India. Buildings with his name in Baku, Azerbaijan, and Istanbul have faced some problems, but the company is undaunted."</p>

				<p class="BS3">"Any company trying to gain access to foreign markets needs to develop ties with business and government figures in those countries. This is partly why it was startling to see Ivanka Trump, who is one of the people entrusted with running Trump’s businesses as he serves as President, sitting in a meeting on Thursday with her father, the President-elect, and Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan. The only reason we know she was there is that the Japanese government released pictures from the event. The Trump transition made no public statement, nor did it allow the press access to the meeting (typically, at a minimum, photographers are invited to take pictures at the beginning or end of such conversations with foreign leaders)."</p>

				<p class="BS3">"Donald Trump has decided not to put his businesses in a blind trust, a mechanism by which his assets would be managed by people with no direct connection to the President. Instead, he has asked his children to continue to manage the global operation, which raises the possibility of an appearance of a conflict of interest. In the case of Ivanka Trump’s presence at a discussion with the Japanese premier, however, the conflict became explicit. In her new role as co-director of the companies, she will oversee negotiations with real-estate developers around the world. While the company hasn’t announced any projects in Japan, it seems reasonable to assume she might talk to companies there. (The Trumps seem to have recognized the awkwardness of the photographs: The Times reported that “an individual close to the family hinted that Ms. Trump would not be attending meetings like this in the future.”)</p>
